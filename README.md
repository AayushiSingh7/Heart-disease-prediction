# Heart-disease-prediction
The Heart Disease Prediction System is a machine learning-based project that predicts the likelihood of heart disease using patient health data. It utilizes multiple classification models, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, XGBoost, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), to analyze medical parameters such as age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and heart rate. The system is trained, tested, and evaluated using various performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to identify the best model for prediction.
